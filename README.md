Proton was getting on my nerves. I used the default light Photon theme.

I do a lot of repetitive mouse/keyboard stuff and I kept clicking on a bubbly tab instead of the search bar text box.

The Firefox Color add-on  (https://color.firefox.com/) is helpful and or you can go ahead and download 
a Photon Theme (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/photon-colors/) 

I still didn't like the dark drop down and dark contextual menus. Or the bubbly tabs.

CSS is super minimal and will only properly work with the Photon Colors theme or a similar one created with Firefox Colors.
